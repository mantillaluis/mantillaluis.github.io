### Current work
- **Master's program @ UBC, 2022**
    - Working together with Dr. Dmytro Bondarenko, Dr. Polina Feldmann,
and Prof. Robert Raussendorf on implementing a quantum recurrent neural network for time-series
processing of quantum data.

- **Consultant @ Xanadu, 2022**
    - Developing quantum error correction tools.

### Previous work

- **Summer Research Intern @ Xanadu, 2022**
    - Working on quantum error correction. Developing [FlamingPy](https://github.com/XanaduAI/flamingpy)

- **Summer research @ Cornell, 2020**
    - *Equilibria and bifurcations of an elastic ring with interacting particles* [[pdf]](../assets/files/spur_cornell.pdf)


### Random projects
- **Zketch, 2022**
    - I created [Zketch.io](https://zketch.io), a tool for designers in a wide range of fields. It uses several diffusion-based models to achieve text-to-image generation and image-to-image transformations.

- **CoolPy, 2022**
    - I created [CoolPy](https://coolpy.carrd.co), a digital academy for people to learn python. I integrated GPT3 into the [academy page](https://academy.coolpy.dev), so users could create code snippets and also practice with python challenges. 

- **TradingBot, 2022** 
    - I tried making a traing bot using reinforcement learning but it did not work (*but it will eventually!*).

- **Warbler, 2022**
    - App for piano students [(see landing page)](https://master.dap87muq6jjvr.amplifyapp.com). Helped developed a python backend hosted on AWS.

- **IPT Team Colombia, 2020** 
    - Participated in the International Physicist Tournament.

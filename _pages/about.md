# About me

My name is Luis Carlos Mantilla Calderon. I am a physicist and matematician 
interested in quantum computing, particularly, in quantum machine learning
and quantum error correction. I also have interests in reinforcement learning 
and optimization. 

Currently, I am a MSc student in Physics at 
[The University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca).
  I am working in Prof. Robert Raussendorf's Quantum Information group exploring 
  quantum machine learning algorithms in the MBQC framework.

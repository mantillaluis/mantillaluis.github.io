My name is Luis Carlos Mantilla Calderon. I am a physicist and matematician 
interested in quantum computing, particularly, in quantum machine learning
and quantum error correction. I also have interests in reinforcement learning 
and optimization. 

Currently, I am a MSc student in Physics at 
[The University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca"),.
  I am working in Prof. Robert Raussendorf's Quantum Information group exploring 
  quantum machine learning algorithms in the MBQC framework. 

# About me

I was born in Barcelona, Spain (1999) and was raised in Floridablanca, 
Colombia. I did my undergraduate in physics and mathematics (2016-2021) at 
[Universidad de los Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co), Bogota. 
I worked in quantum error correction and deep reinforcement learning for my 
physics and mathematics program, respectively.  
I started my master degree in physics (2021-Preset) at the 
[University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca), Vancouver.
